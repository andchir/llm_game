# Aim Control Fix Test Plan

## Problem Identified
The bullets were flying in the wrong direction because:
1. Mouse movement updated `localPlayer.angle` on the client
2. Angle updates were only sent to server when player moved (arrow keys)
3. When shooting, server used stale angle data
4. Result: Bullets went in old direction, not where mouse was pointing

## Solution Implemented
1. Added throttled angle updates on mouse movement (50ms throttle = max 20 updates/sec)
2. Added `sendAngleUpdate()` method to send angle-only updates
3. Modified `shoot()` to send current angle immediately before shooting
4. This ensures server always has the most up-to-date aiming angle

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing
1. Start server: `python server/game_server.py`
2. Open browser at `http://localhost:8080`
3. Move mouse around without moving player - gun indicator should follow smoothly
4. Click to shoot - bullets should go where mouse is pointing
5. Move player with arrow keys while moving mouse - aim should still be accurate
6. Test rapid mouse movements and shooting - should be responsive

### Expected Behavior
- Gun indicator follows mouse cursor smoothly
- Bullets fly exactly where the mouse is pointing
- No jerky movements or lag in aim
- Shooting feels responsive and accurate

### Performance Considerations
- Throttle set to 50ms to avoid overwhelming server with messages
- Only sends angle updates when angle actually changes
- Immediate angle update before shooting ensures accuracy

## Code Changes
- `static/game.js:34-35`: Added throttle variables
- `static/game.js:155-179`: Modified mousemove handler with throttled updates
- `static/game.js:247-258`: Added sendAngleUpdate() method
- `static/game.js:273`: Send angle update before shooting
